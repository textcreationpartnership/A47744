            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Treatiſes being out of Print, it was thought beſt to Re-print them in the ſame Volume with The <hi>Snake</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;</hi> that that Author's Works upon this Subject might be all alike, and more portable. So that if others of them ſhould be Re-printed, or New Added, it will be no prejudice to them who have this.</p>
            <p>There is one ſmall thing added to this, which was wrote before that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor did engage with the <hi>Quakers:</hi> It is a <hi>Letter concerning the Socinian
<pb facs="tcp:59246:3"/>Trinity.</hi> But it is as proper for the <hi>Quaker,</hi> as the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controverſy, for they are all one upon this Point. And the <hi>Quakers</hi> have the ſame <hi>Salvo's</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> to reconcile their <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> making it only Three <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>Operations.</hi> And are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for the many <hi>Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> of this their <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> which they have taken up, to avoid the far leſs Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which they apprehended to be greater in the Catholick Doctrine of Three <hi>Perſons</hi> in One and the ſame Pure <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſmall thing being only a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Private Friend (which he procur'd to be printed) was not meant to comprehend all that Controverſy; but to give, in ſhort, a Summary View of it: To ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:59246:3"/>their Exceptions; And that they are divided into more, and more <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory</hi> and <hi>Fundamentally Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> Different and Oppoſite <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> than what they object in the ſeveral <hi>Explanations</hi> of the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> upon that <hi>Unfathomable</hi> and <hi>Glorious Myſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it pleaſe God to lend that Author Health and Ability, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to conſider of that Controverſy with greater Care. He not thinking it ſufficient to have proved the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> to be <hi>Socinians,</hi> (though many of them know it not) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out likewiſe ſhewing the <hi>Falacy</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> upon which both of them do proceed. Which was not the Buſineſs of his Works againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> they denying themſelves to
<pb facs="tcp:59246:4"/>be <hi>Socinians,</hi> and laying that Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon others, with great <hi>Contumely</hi> and <hi>Contempt;</hi> as is ſhew'd in <hi>The Snake, Sect. XI.</hi> It was enough, upon that Point, to let them, and the World ſee, that they were <hi>Real,</hi> though not <hi>Nominal Socinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if God ſhall ſo bleſs his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as to ſpeak to the Heart of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſie, then will not only <hi>They</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> be detected for meerly <hi>Nominal Chriſtians;</hi> but the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion will be more and more vindicated; and we be ſtill further Confirmed and Built up in our moſt Holy Faith.</p>

                  <head>A PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AS Baptiſm</hi> is putting on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> giving up our Names to Him; being Admitted as His <hi>Diſciples;</hi> and a <hi>Publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of His <hi>Doctrin:</hi> So the Renouncing of our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is as <hi>Publick</hi> a <hi>Diſowning</hi> of Him; and a Formal <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> from His <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Devil</hi> has been moſt buſie in all Ages (but has prevail'd moſt, in our latter Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Times) to Prejudice Men, by many falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, againſt this <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi> Having been able to perſwade ſome quite to throw it off, as <hi>Pernicious</hi> and <hi>Hurtful:</hi> Others to think it only <hi>Lawful</hi> to be done, but to lay no great ſtreſs upon it, and ſo uſe it, where it is Enjoyned, as a thing <hi>Indifferent.</hi> Others deny it to <hi>Infants,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this only Ground, That they are not ſuppos'd Capable of being Admitted into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which He has made with Men: For, if they are Capable of being admitted into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> there can be no Reaſon to deny them the outward <hi>Seal</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>But this being Foreign to my preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is to Demonſtrate to the <hi>Quakers</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:59246:8"/>Neceſſity of an <hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> in the General (for as to Perſons capable of it, we have no Controverſie with thoſe who deny it to All) therefore, I have not digreſs'd into another Subject, which is, that of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> in the following <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Yet thus much I will ſay of it, in this place, That <hi>Infants</hi> are Capable of being admitted into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and therefore that they cannot be Excluded from the outward <hi>Seal</hi> of it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> cannot deny. And that they are Capable, I thus prove. They were Capable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law,</hi> and before the <hi>Law,</hi> of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as Members of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the <hi>Seal</hi> of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> at the Age of <hi>Eight Days:</hi> And therefore there can be no Reaſon to Exclude them from the ſame Privilege, to the ſame <hi>Covenant,</hi> now that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come; unleſs <hi>Chriſt</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd them from it: The <hi>Law</hi> ſtanding ſtill, as it was, where He has not <hi>Alter'd,</hi> or <hi>Fulfill'd</hi> it. But He has not debarr'd them. Nay, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, He has yet further confirm'd their being within the <hi>Covenant.</hi> He called a <hi>Little Child,</hi> (Matth. <hi>xviii. 2, 3, 5.</hi>) and ſet him in the midſt of His <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and Propoſed him as a Pattern to <hi>Them,</hi> and to all <hi>Adult</hi> Chriſtians. And ſaid, That none ſhould <hi>enter into the Kindom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, except thoſe who ſhould become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children.</hi> And that who ever did Receive a <hi>Little Child</hi> in <hi>His Name,</hi> did Receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf. And <hi>(ver. 10.) in Heaven, their Angels</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>do always behold the Face of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven.</hi> And therefore He
<pb facs="tcp:59246:8"/>bids us <hi>Take heed that we deſpiſe not one of theſe Little Ones;</hi> by which term tho' <hi>Adult</hi> Perſons are ſometimes meant, yet in the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted, it is expreſly apply'd to <hi>Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> And what greater <hi>Deſpiſing</hi> of them can be than to Reject them as no Members of <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> and conſequently unworthy of the <hi>outward Seal</hi> of His <hi>Covenant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> with His <hi>Diſciples (Mar. x. 14.)</hi> for hindring <hi>young Children</hi> to be brought unto Him. And will He be <hi>pleaſed</hi> with the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> for the ſame thing? <hi>He took the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren up in His Arms, put His hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</hi> Did he <hi>Bleſs</hi> thoſe who were not <hi>Capable</hi> of being within His <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of God,</hi> (which is a term our <hi>Saviour</hi> us'd, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) Are they not then within the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſays, that where either of the Parents is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (<hi>1 Cor.</hi> vii. <hi>14.</hi>) the <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>Holy:</hi> That is, within the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And purſuant to this, when any Man was Converted, his <hi>Children</hi> were <hi>Baptized</hi> with himſelf. This is the meaning of what we read ſo often in <hi>The Acts,</hi> that ſuch a Man was <hi>Baptized</hi> with his <hi>Houſhold.</hi> And it was the Cuſtom before with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when they admitted any Man as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte to their Religion, they <hi>Baptized</hi> his <hi>Children</hi> with himſelf. Let this ſuffice for the preſent. And Proceed.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. When <hi>Rebellion</hi> had fully compleated it ſelf, in the <hi>Murther</hi> of the King, <hi>1648.</hi> It ſoon ſpawn'd a multifarious <hi>Schiſm</hi> of <hi>30</hi> or <hi>40</hi> different <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59246:9"/>in <hi>England,</hi> at the ſame time, of which Catalogues were then Printed, moſt of all theſe threw away <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And threaten'd an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and total Overthrow of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in this Iſland. But, by the great Mercy of God, the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with the <hi>King, 1660.</hi> has extinguiſhed the very <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> of theſe, all but <hi>4</hi> or <hi>5</hi> of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Sects.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> (Mother of all the reſt) <hi>Independents, Ana-baptiſts, Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Muggletonians.</hi> I am told of ſome <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers,</hi> got up of late. But they are yet inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. They may Increaſe, and all the reſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, if warm'd by a Plenitude of <hi>Indulgence.</hi> The <hi>Socinians,</hi> or <hi>Unitarians,</hi> are already got very high, who make nothing of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but as <hi>Ineffectual Forms.</hi> So think the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who pretend to higher Quality than theſe. And the <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> will quarrel with none of theſe. All <hi>Deiſts</hi> are <hi>Latitudinarians;</hi> and, tho' they deſpiſe <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and all <hi>Reveal'd</hi> Inſtitutions, yet they can ſubmit to them, becauſe they are <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> as they would to any thing elſe, rather than loſe a <hi>Penny,</hi> or their <hi>Eaſe.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Muggletonians</hi> have (more ſincerely) Rejected <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as not allowable, becauſe they think ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> &amp;c. do indeed uſe <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but as a thing ſo <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> that many of them will ſuffer a Child to dye without it, rather than Baptize it <hi>Privately,</hi> or not upon a <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Lecture-day,</hi> or before <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> rather than after it; And an Inſtance can be given, ſince this late Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Presbytery</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59246:9"/>in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of a Child who dyed in the Church in <hi>Sermon-time;</hi> but the Miniſter ſuffer'd that, and the repeated Requeſts of the <hi>Parents,</hi> rather than go out of his wonted method of <hi>Baptizing after Sermon,</hi> he thought <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſo little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial!</p>
                  <p>But the People being us'd to a greater veneration of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> under the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Adminiſtration, and taking the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> contempt of it ſomewhat uneaſily, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters there, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them better, had publick Preachments, all over the Nation, to ſhew the no Neceſſity of the <hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi> I will not ſay the <hi>ENGLISH Presbyterians</hi> go ſo far; they are one Degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi> I hear that they do now Adminiſter <hi>Baptiſm PRIVATELY,</hi> in and about <hi>London.</hi> Which the <hi>Independents</hi> do ſtill Refuſe, (I have it from ſome of themſelves) let the caſe be never ſo urgent, even tho' the Child ſhould dye without it, before one of their <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Lecture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</hi> As for the other <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> I hear that ſome <hi>Independent</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>London</hi> are come to uſe it <hi>Monthly.</hi> And the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> more frequently than they us'd to do; or than they do in other places. The frequency of <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Churches, in ſome manner forcing them to it, that their People might not think themſelves more neglected by them, than others are. But their own <hi>Inclination,</hi> and the <hi>Value</hi> they have for this <hi>Sacrament</hi> will better appear by their Behaviour while they had the Power in their own hands; and could <hi>Dictat</hi> to others, inſtead of <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> or <hi>Complying</hi> with them. And during their <hi>Government</hi> in the late <hi>Revolution,</hi> tho' they did
<pb facs="tcp:59246:10"/>not down-right (as the <hi>Quakers</hi>) declare <hi>War</hi> againſt it, and <hi>Extirpate</hi> it at <hi>once;</hi> yet they plainly ſeem'd to have had a deſign to have <hi>Inch'd</hi> it by Degrees out of the World, as far as it was in their power, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it fall into <hi>Diſſuetude,</hi> that ſo it might be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi> and <hi>Dye.</hi> And they had almoſt Effected it, among thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>happy People that were led by them. For from the Birth of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> A. D. <hi>1638.</hi> they had not this Sacrament in may <hi>Pariſhes</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſome for <hi>10,</hi> ſome for <hi>12,</hi> ſome for <hi>15</hi> years; which was almoſt their whole <hi>Reign.</hi> And in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd</hi> and <hi>Conniv'd</hi> at Pariſhes to the Year <hi>1683,</hi> many Perſons (who were not Deharr'd for any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt them) ſome of <hi>50, 60, 70,</hi> and <hi>80</hi> years of Age, never receiv'd this <hi>Sacrament</hi> once in their lives: This I know from certain Information. And ſince their preſent Eſtabliſhment in this <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> their neglect of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> is likeweſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. Four Years after which, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year <hi>1693</hi> it had not been Adminiſtred in <hi>Edenbrugh;</hi> and but once a year, at the moſt, ſince. We may imagine then how it has been obſerv'd in the Country Pariſhes.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are a <hi>Sprig</hi> of the <hi>Scoth Covenant</hi> Tranſplanted thither: Which in that change of Soil, has taken deep Root, and ſpread Intolerably. And the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> in his late Clear and Rational <hi>Diſcourſe concerning the Inventions of Men in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God,</hi> And <hi>Two</hi> following <hi>Admonitions,</hi> has made it fully appear, That not <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Ten</hi> of them do ever Receive this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the whole Courſe of their Lives: And the reſt very rarely, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now ſince this laſt Revolution. And in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Revolution of <hi>41,</hi> he gives <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndenyable Inſtances,
<pb facs="tcp:59246:10"/>that in ſeveral Churches, even in <hi>Dublin,</hi> after the turning out of the <hi>Epiſcopal Miniſters,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> had not been Adminiſter'd till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, <hi>1660,</hi> that is, in ſome Churches for <hi>Ten,</hi> in ſome for <hi>Twelve</hi> Years together.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>V.</hi> Theſe <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and had learnt the contempt of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there. Where, even in <hi>Oxford,</hi> it was not <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred</hi> in the whole <hi>Univerſity,</hi> from the Eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi> in the Year <hi>1648.</hi> to the Reſtauration in <hi>1660.</hi> as is obſerved in the <hi>Antiquit.

                     <hi>VI.</hi> And from all theſe Enemies, and the ſubtle Inſinuations which they have broached in Prejudice of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Holy Inſtitution of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and likewiſe of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> (for both are ſlighted by the ſame Perſons, and upon the ſame Grounds) it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſeveral, even of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have been wrought, tho' not into a <hi>Diſ-uſe,</hi> or down-right <hi>ſlight,</hi> yet into a leſs <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and greater <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> as to theſe <hi>Holy Sacraments</hi> than they ought; and conſequently receive leſs Benefit by them; much leſs than if their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and their <hi>Faith</hi> were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rooted, and more ſublime. Nay, there is not any Degree of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> but what is culpable, in this caſe; and may bring a <hi>Curſe</hi> with it, inſtead of a <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> For, <hi>whatſoever,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Religious</hi> Worſhip, <hi>is not of Faith, is ſin.</hi> And according to our <hi>Faith,</hi> it is to us, in all our Performances of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

                     <hi>VII.</hi> For all theſe Reaſons, tho' this Diſcourſe was
<pb facs="tcp:59246:11"/>wrote wholly on Behalf of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet, I hope, it will not be unuſeful to many others, to ſee the <hi>ſtrong Foundation, Great Neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>Ineſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> when Duly Adminiſter'd, and Receiv'd with <hi>Full Faith</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that He will not fail to aſſiſt His own <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> when we approach unto them, with ſincere <hi>Repentance,</hi> and undoubting Dependance upon His <hi>Promiſes.</hi> And many of the Objections hereafter anſwer'd, tho' uſed by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to <hi>Invalidate BAPTISM,</hi> are likewiſe inſiſted on by ſeveral of the <hi>Sects,</hi> which I have nam'd above, to <hi>Leſſen</hi> and <hi>Diſparage</hi> it.

                     <hi>VIII.</hi> But as to the immediate Occaſion, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me in this Work, it was upon the Account of a particular Perſon, who had been Educated from his Childhood in the <hi>Quaker</hi> Principles, and Communion.

                        <p>
                           <hi>That</hi> Matth. xxxviii. 19. <hi>was meant of</hi> Water-Baptiſm.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Words of the Text are theſe: <hi>Go ye, therefore, and Teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> will not own that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> here mentioned was the <hi>Outward,</hi> or <hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> Which I will endeavour to make very plain, that it was; and that in the firſt place,</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Signification</hi> and <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word <hi>Baptize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59246:13"/>
                     <p n="1">I. The word is a <hi>Greek</hi> word, and only made <hi>Engliſh</hi> by our conſtant uſage of it: It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to <hi>Waſh,</hi> and is apply'd to this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe that is an outward <hi>Waſhing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>Waſh</hi> and to <hi>Baptize</hi> are the very ſame; and if the word <hi>Baptize</hi> had been rendred into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> inſtead of, <hi>Go and BAPTIZE,</hi> it muſt have been ſaid, <hi>Go and WASH Men, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> is as much here commanded, as if it had been expreſſed in <hi>Engliſh</hi> words, or as we can now expreſs it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the word <hi>Baptize</hi> was grown a Technical Term, in other Languages, whereby to expreſs the Holy Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> long before our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, therefore our Tranſlators did rightly retain the word <hi>Baptize</hi> in this Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. and in other Texts which ſpeak of that <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in other places they tranſlate the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> vii. 4. <hi>When they come from the Market</hi>

                        </gap>, except they are <hi>Baptized,</hi> which we literally tranſlate except they <hi>Waſh.</hi> And in the ſame Verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. The <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of <hi>Cups</hi> and <hi>Pots,</hi> &amp;c. which we tranſlate the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>Cups</hi> and <hi>Pots.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 10. ſpeaking of theſe Legal Inſtitutions, <hi>which ſtood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and carnal Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. the word which we here tranſlate <hi>Waſhings,</hi> is, in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Baptiſms: In Meats and Drinks, and divers Baptiſms.</hi> And in the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> word is retained in both
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59246:13"/>theſe Texts, <hi>Mark</hi> vii. 4. <hi>Niſi Baptizentur, non Comedunt.</hi> Except they are <hi>Baptized,</hi> i. e. <hi>Waſh</hi> their <hi>Hands,</hi> they eat not. And <hi>Baptiſmata Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of <hi>Cups,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 10. <hi>In Cibis &amp; Pontibus, &amp; variis Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmatibus,</hi> i. e. <hi>In Meats and Drinks, and divers Baptiſms.</hi> So that it is plain that the word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and the word <hi>Waſhing,</hi> tho' not the ſame word, have yet the ſelf-ſame meaning.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is true, that the word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is often taken in a <hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> Senſe, to mean the INWARD BAPTISM, the <hi>Waſhing,</hi> or <hi>Cleanſing</hi> of the <hi>Heart:</hi> But ſo is the word <hi>Waſhing</hi> alſo, as often, as <hi>Jer.</hi> iv. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is ſcarce a Word in the World but is capable of many <hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Thus <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is very often us'd for the <hi>Inward Circumciſion</hi> or <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Heart.</hi> And <hi>Fire</hi> is taken to expreſs <hi>Love,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and many other things.</p>
                     <p>But it is a receiv'd Rule for the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and indeed of all other <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> that the plain <hi>Literal</hi> Meaning is always to be taken, where there is no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> in it; as when a Man is ſaid to have a <hi>Fire</hi> burning in his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> it cannot be meant of the <hi>Literal Fire:</hi> So when we are commanded to <hi>Waſh</hi> or <hi>Circumciſe</hi> our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and the like. But on the other hand, if any Man will take upon him to underſtand Words in a <hi>Figurative Senſe,</hi> at his own will and pleaſure, without an apparent Neceſſity from the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Cohenrence,</hi> he ſets up to <hi>Banter,</hi> and leaves no <hi>Certainty</hi> in any <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59246:14"/>in the World. Therefore I will conclude this Point of the natural <hi>Signification</hi> and <hi>Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology</hi> of the word <hi>Baptize:</hi> And, unleſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> can ſhew an apparent <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> to take it in the <hi>Literal Signification,</hi> in this Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. then it muſt be meant of the OUTWARD WASHING or BAPTISM, becauſe that is the only <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Proper,</hi> and <hi>Literal</hi> Signification of the Word.</p>
                     <p>And it will be further Demonſtrated in the next <hi>Section,</hi> that there can be no <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> to take it in a <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Others thereunto <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> by them, did Practiſe it, in the <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>I. <hi>That</hi> CHRIST <hi>did Practiſe</hi> Water-Baptiſm. II. <hi>That the Apoſtles did it after</hi> Him. III. <hi>That the</hi> Catholick Church <hi>have done it after</hi> Them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">I. THat <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Practiſe <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi> It is written, <hi>John</hi> iii. 26. <hi>And they came unto John, and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, He that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bareſt witneſs, Behold, the ſame Baptizeth, and all Men come to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this was <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> there can be no Doubt, becauſe,</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59246:14"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> was not yet given: For that was not given till the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> fifty Days after the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it is Recorded in the Second of the <hi>Acts.</hi> This <hi>Spiritual Baptiſm</hi> was promiſed, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 16, 26. xv. 26. xvi. 7. And the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> were commanded to tarry in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till it ſhould come upon them, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 49.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Quakers</hi> allow that <hi>John</hi> did <hi>Baptize</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> and there is no other ſort of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> here mentioned, with which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize;</hi> and therefore, theſe <hi>Baptiſms</hi> being ſpoke of both together, there can be no Reaſon to interpret the <hi>one</hi> to be with <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> not. It is ſaid <hi>John</hi> iv. 1. <hi>The Phariſees heard that Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples than John.</hi> How cou'd the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hear of it, if it was not an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Baptiſm?</hi> For, as before is ſaid, the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> Effects of the <hi>Baptiſms with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> were not then given. And ſince it was an <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> it muſt be the <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> for there was <hi>then</hi> no other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtart an <hi>Objection</hi> here, That it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> iv. 2. <hi>Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ. Tho' Jeſus himſelf baptized not,</hi> yet it is ſaid in the <hi>Verſe</hi> foregoing, that <hi>He made</hi> and <hi>baptized,</hi> i. e. thoſe whom <hi>His Diſciples,</hi> by His Order, <hi>Baptized.</hi> For, if it had not been done <hi>by His Order,</hi> it cou'd not be ſaid that he had <hi>Baptized</hi> thoſe whom his Diſciples <hi>Baptized.</hi> But becauſe, <hi>He that doeth a thing by Another,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>do it Himſelf,</hi> therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59246:15"/>is ſaid to have <hi>Baptized</hi> thoſe, whom his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by his Order, did <hi>Baptize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That <hi>Baptizing</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have Adminiſtred <hi>himſelf, John</hi> iii. 26. might have been at another <hi>Time</hi> than that which is mention'd in the 4th <hi>Chapter:</hi> And then the conſequence will only be this, That, at <hi>ſome Times, Chriſt</hi> did Baptize <hi>Himſelf;</hi> and at <hi>other Times,</hi> he left it to his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Tho', as to our Argument, it is the ſame thing, whether he did it <hi>Himſelf,</hi> or commanded his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to do it. For, either way, it is <hi>his Baptiſm, his Onely;</hi> his <hi>Diſciples</hi> did but <hi>Adminiſter</hi> what he commanded.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf did <hi>Baptize</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> by his Commandment, while he was with them upon Earth; ſo did his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and Others thereunto by them commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, after his <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Command to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. after he was riſen from the Dead.</p>
                     <p>What is ſaid above of the <hi>Etymology</hi> and true <hi>Signification</hi> of the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> is, of it ſelf, ſufficient to prove, that by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in this <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> is meant: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially till the <hi>Quakers</hi> can ſhew any <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> in having the word taken in the <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe, in this, and the other <hi>Texts</hi> which ſpeak of it.</p>
                     <p>And this will be very hard to do, ſince, as it is juſt now proved, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>Baptize</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> as well as <hi>John.</hi> And what <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</hi> or <hi>Contradiction</hi> can be alledged, that his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſhou'd Adminiſter the ſame ſort of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> after his <hi>Death,</hi> as he had <hi>Practiſed</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59246:15"/>Commanded during his <hi>Life?</hi> Nay rather, what Reaſon can be given, why they ſhou'd not be the ſame, ſince the ſame <hi>word,</hi> i. e. <hi>Baptize,</hi> is us'd in Both, and no new <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Acceptation</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> is ſo much as hinted? And therefore to put any new <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Acceptation</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> muſt be wholly <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Precarious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, as I promis'd, I will Demonſtrate yet more fully and plainly, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did <hi>Practiſe</hi> the <hi>Outward,</hi> i. e. <hi>Water-baptiſm</hi> after CHRIST's <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Acts x. 47. <hi>Can any Man forbid</hi> Water, <hi>that theſe ſhou'd not be Baptized?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Acts viii. 36. <hi>As they</hi> (Philip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch) <hi>went on their way, they came to a certain</hi> Water, <hi>and the Eunuch ſaid, See here is</hi> Water, <hi>what doth hinder me to be Baptized?</hi> — <hi>And</hi> (Verſe 38.) <hi>they went both down into the</hi> Water, <hi>both Philip and the Eunuch, and he Baptized him: And when they were come up out of the</hi> WATER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Acts xxii. 16. <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and be Baptized, and</hi> Waſh <hi>away thy ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, to ſave more Quotations, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do own that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14. and 17. was <hi>Water-baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore I will conclude this Point, as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did practiſe <hi>Water-baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Argument from thence will lie thus: The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did practiſe that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. But the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did practiſe <hi>Water-baptiſm;</hi> therefore <hi>Water-baptiſm</hi> was that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19.</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59246:16"/>
                     <p n="3">III. And, as the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> is a moſt ſure Rule whereby to underſtand the meaning of that <hi>Command</hi> which they put in <hi>execution;</hi> ſo the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of thoſe who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeded the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were Cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries with them, and learn'd the Faith from their Mouths, is as certain a Rule to know what the <hi>Practiſe,</hi> and what the <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were. And thus the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age,</hi> in the Adminiſtration of <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> is an undeniable Evidence, that this was the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age;</hi> the ſame Perſons being, many of them, alive in both the <hi>laſt</hi> and the <hi>preſent Age.</hi> For one <hi>Age</hi> does not go off the World all at once, and another ſucceed all of <hi>perfect Age</hi> together; but there are <hi>old Men</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> and <hi>young Men</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to another <hi>Age</hi> all alive upon the Earth the ſame time; and <hi>Mankind</hi> being diſperſed into far diſtant <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Climates,</hi> who know not of one another, nor hold any Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence: It is, by theſe means, morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> to deceive us in what has been the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and Receiv'd <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> to which the <hi>preſent Age</hi> is ſo linked, that it is even a part of it: I ſay it is impoſſible for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the World to be ſuppos'd <hi>willing,</hi> or if they were, to be <hi>capable</hi> of impoſing upon all <hi>younger</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, namely, That they had been all <hi>Baptized,</hi> and that this was an univerſal receiv'd <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and of which <hi>Regiſters</hi> were always kept, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Pariſh,</hi> of <hi>all</hi> who had been, from time to time, <hi>Baptized;</hi> and that ſuch <hi>Regiſters</hi> were <hi>publick,</hi> and to be recurr'd to by all that had a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59246:16"/>mind to it: Every Man's reaſon will tell him that it is utterly impoſſible for ſuch a thing to paſs upon Mankind.</p>
                     <p>And as certainly as the <hi>preſent Age</hi> is thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> in a Thing of ſo <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> a nature; ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by the ſame Rules, muſt the <hi>laſt Age</hi> know the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Age</hi> before that; and ſo backward all the way to the <hi>firſt Inſtitution,</hi> to the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>publick</hi> nature of this <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> as now practiſed, being an <hi>outward</hi> matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> of which Men's <hi>outward Senſes,</hi> their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> are <hi>Judges;</hi> not like Matters of <hi>Opinion,</hi> which ſort of <hi>Tares</hi> may be <hi>privately</hi> ſown, and <hi>long time</hi> propagated, without any remarkable Diſcovery; and to this ſo <hi>publick</hi> matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> adding the <hi>univerſal</hi> Practiſe of it, through all the far diſtant Nations of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> I ſay theſe two <hi>Marks</hi> make it impoſſible for the World to be impos'd upon, nor was it ever, or ever can be impos'd upon in any ſuch <hi>publick</hi> Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> ſo <hi>univerſally</hi> practiſed. All this makes it undeniably plain, That the <hi>laſt Age</hi> did <hi>practiſe</hi> the ſame <hi>outward Water-baptiſm</hi> which is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in <hi>this Age;</hi> and that the ſame was, as certainly, practis'd in the <hi>Age</hi> before the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> and by the ſame Rule, in the <hi>Age</hi> before that; and ſo onward, as aboveſaid, to the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> I have made more Words of this than needed, but I wou'd render it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding plain, conſidering with whom I have to do.

                        <p>That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> muſt be <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible,</hi> becauſe it is an Ordinance appointed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to <hi>Initiate</hi> Men into an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſibly Society,</hi> which is the <hi>Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere goes no more towards the proving of this, than to ſhew, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> is an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Society. 2dly,</hi> That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was appointed and us'd for <hi>Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or <hi>Admitting</hi> Men into the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> is an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> Society. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls it, <hi>A City that is ſet on a Hill</hi> (Matth. v. 14.) The <hi>Quakers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Society;</hi> and ſo are all thoſe who bear the Name of <hi>Churches</hi> upon Earth. They cou'd not otherwiſe be <hi>Churches.</hi> For that implies a <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>People;</hi> and every <hi>Society</hi> in the World, is an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible</hi> Thing.</p>
                     <p>And, as it is ſo, has an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Form</hi> of admitting Men into it: For otherwiſe it wou'd not be known who are <hi>Members</hi> of it. Every <hi>Society</hi> is <hi>Excluſive</hi> of all others who are not of that <hi>Society;</hi> otherwiſe it cou'd not be a <hi>Society:</hi> For that ſuppoſes the Men of that <hi>Society,</hi> to be thereby diſtinguſhed from other Men: And that ſuppoſes as much that there muſt be ſome <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible</hi> Form where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to <hi>Initiate</hi> Men, and intitle them to be <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59246:18"/>of ſuch a <hi>Society;</hi> otherwiſe it cou'd not be known who were <hi>Members</hi> of it, and who were not; and it wou'd thereby <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ceaſe to be a <hi>Society;</hi> for it cou'd not then be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of Mankind: as a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> is loſt in the <hi>Sea,</hi> becauſe it is no longer diſtinguiſhed from it, but goes to make up a part of it.</p>
                     <p>From hence it appears, that the <hi>Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Society,</hi> muſt have ſome <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Form</hi> to <hi>Initiate</hi> Men, and make them <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Society.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2dly,</hi> That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was that <hi>Outward Form.</hi> All the ſeveral <hi>Baptiſms</hi> that were before <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> were all meant for <hi>Initiating Forms.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had a Cuſtom long before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>Initiate</hi> the <hi>Proſelites</hi> or <hi>Converts</hi> to their Religion, not only by <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but by <hi>Baptizing,</hi> or <hi>Waſhing</hi> them with <hi>Water.</hi> The ſame was the meaning of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to make Men his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> And the ſame was the meaning of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> to <hi>initiate</hi> Men into the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and make them <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence <hi>Baptizing</hi> Men, and making them <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> mean the ſame thing. Thus <hi>John</hi> iv. 1. it is ſaid, That <hi>Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples than John.</hi> That is, he <hi>baptized</hi> them <hi>Diſciples,</hi> which was the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Making</hi> them ſuch. If any will ſay, that he <hi>Baptized</hi> them to be <hi>Diſciples</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> that will be anſwer'd <hi>Sect.</hi> VI. But as to the preſent Point, it is the ſame thing whoſe <hi>Diſciples</hi> they were made; for we are now only to ſhew that <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, was an <hi>Initiated Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59246:18"/>
                     <p>And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> practiſed it, as well as <hi>John,</hi> as this Text does expreſly declare, no Reaſon can be given that he did not uſe it as an <hi>Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Form,</hi> as well as <hi>John;</hi> eſpecially when the Text does expreſs that he did <hi>make</hi> them <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> by <hi>Baptizing</hi> of them, as above is ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>And purſuant to this, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to convert <hi>all Nations,</hi> his Commiſſion of <hi>Baptizing</hi> was as large as that of <hi>Teaching,</hi> Matth. xxviii. 19. <hi>Go</hi> TEACH <hi>all Nations,</hi> BAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIZING <hi>them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.

                     </p>
                     <p>And accordinly we find it the conſtant Cuſtom to <hi>baptize</hi> all that were converted to the <hi>Faith.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' <hi>miraculouſly</hi> converted from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> was commanded to be <hi>baptized,</hi> Acts xxii. 16. And he <hi>baptized Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and their Houſholds, as ſoon as he had converted them, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 15, 33. And the <hi>Corinthians, Acts</hi> xviii. 8. And the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> who had not yet been made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Acts xix. 5. <hi>Philip</hi> did <hi>Baptize</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as ſoon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Acts viii. 37, 38. And <hi>Peter,</hi> immediately upon the Converſion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe with him, ſaid, <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhou'd not be baptiz'd?</hi> Acts x. 47.</p>
                     <p>It wou'd be endleſs to enumerate all the like Inſtances of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And it was always us'd as an <hi>Initiating Form.</hi>

                        <hi>3dly, Baptiſm</hi> was not only an <hi>Initiating Form:</hi> But it ſerv'd for nothing elſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſaid of the other Sacrament (of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>) <hi>as often as ye eat this Bread,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. xi. 26. This was to be <hi>often</hi> repeated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is our <hi>Admiſſion, Initiation,</hi> or <hi>Birth,</hi> into the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and accordingly <hi>once only</hi> to be adminiſtred.

                     <p>And as of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s, ſo of other <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> of <hi>John</hi>'s, and the <hi>Jews,</hi> they being only <hi>Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Forms,</hi> they were not <hi>repeated.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> did not <hi>Baptize</hi> their <hi>Proſelites</hi> more than <hi>once.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> did not <hi>Baptize</hi> his <hi>Diſciples</hi> more than <hi>once.</hi> So neither were Men <hi>twice Baptized</hi> into the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> more than they were <hi>twice Circumciſed,</hi> or <hi>Admitted</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> before <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Quakers <hi>ſay,</hi> 1ſt, <hi>That the</hi> BAPTISM <hi>commanded</hi> Matth. xxviii. 19. <hi>was only meant of the</hi> Inward <hi>and</hi> Spiritual <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THey <hi>ſay</hi> this; and that is all. They neither pretend to <hi>anſwer</hi> the <hi>Arguments</hi> brought againſt them, ſuch as theſe before-mentioned; nor give any <hi>Proof</hi> for their own <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they <hi>ſay ſo;</hi> and they <hi>will</hi> believe it; and there is an End of it.</p>
                     <p>And truly there ſhou'd be an End of it, if only <hi>Diſputation,</hi> or <hi>Victory</hi> were my Deſign: For to what <hi>non plus</hi> can any Adverſary be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd beyond that of neither <hi>Anſwering,</hi> nor <hi>Proving?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Pains I have taken is only in Charity for their Souls, I will over-look all their Impertinency, and deal with them as with weyward Children, humour them, and follow them thro' all their <hi>Windings</hi> and <hi>Turnings;</hi> and ſubmit to <hi>over-prove,</hi> what is abundantly <hi>prov'd</hi> already. Therefore, ſince they can give no Reaſon why <hi>that Baptiſm</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. ſhou'd be meant <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and wou'd be content that we ſhou'd leave them there, as obſtinate Men, and purſue them no further; but let them perſwade thoſe whom they can perſwade: By which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod (unhappily yielded to them) they have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59246:20"/>gain'd and ſecur'd moſt of their <hi>Proſelites,</hi> by keeping them from <hi>Diſputing</hi> or <hi>Reaſoning;</hi> and by perſwading them to hearken only to their own <hi>Light within:</hi> To reſcue them out of this Snare, I will be content to undertake the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> (tho' againſt the Rules of Argument,) and to prove, that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. was not the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To <hi>Baptize</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone. For none can <hi>Baptize</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but who can <hi>ſend</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Which is <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to any Creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Christ</hi> has indeed committed the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Outward Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and to Others by them thereunto <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;</hi> and has promiſed the <hi>Inward Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to thoſe who ſhall <hi>duly</hi> receive the <hi>Outward Baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this cannot give the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Title of <hi>Baptizing</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> tho' the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may be given by their <hi>Miniſtration.</hi> For they are not the <hi>Givers,</hi> that is <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And purſuant to this, it is obſervable, that none is ever ſaid, in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to <hi>Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone: <hi>The ſame is he who Baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John i. 33.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, if that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. was the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> it wou'd follow that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cou'd <hi>baptize</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> to aſſert.</p>

                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59246:21"/>but <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was <hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> therefore <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was the <hi>Jews Baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was <hi>John</hi>'s, and <hi>John</hi>'s was the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> was <hi>Chriſt's;</hi> and they were <hi>all</hi> one and the ſelf-ſame <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> becauſe they were all <hi>Water-baptiſms.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of <hi>John</hi> were not the ſame: and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>baptize</hi> Men to be <hi>his own</hi> Diſciples, and not to be the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>John:</hi> and therefore the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John.</hi>

But however the <hi>Quakers</hi> may argue from <hi>Paul</hi>'s Complyance with the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> has reaſon to complain of my <hi>Complyance</hi> with <hi>Them:</hi> For, after all that has been ſaid, there is not one ſingle Word in any Text of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that does ſo much as hint at any ſuch thing, as that <hi>Peter</hi>'s Baptizing of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi>'s Baptizing of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> was in any ſort of <hi>Complyance</hi> unto <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> This is a perfect Figment, out of the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s own Brain, without any Ground or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World: And therefore there was no need of Anſwering it at all, otherwiſe than to bid the <hi>Quakers</hi> prove their <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> That theſe <hi>Baptiſms</hi> were in Complyance with <hi>John</hi>'s, which they cou'd never have done.</p>
                     <p>Whereas it is plain from the Words of the Text (<hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 3.) that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Circumciſing <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> was in Complyance with the <hi>Jews:</hi> It is expreſly ſo ſaid, and the Reaſon of it given, becauſe, tho' his <hi>Mother</hi> was a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> yet his <hi>Father</hi> was a <hi>Greek;</hi> and therefore, <hi>becauſe of the</hi> Jews <hi>which were in thoſe Quarters</hi> (ſays the Text) he Circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> might <hi>Hear</hi> and <hi>Receive</hi> him, which, otherwiſe, they wou'd not have done.

                     <p>For what <hi>Truth</hi> is there ſo evident in the World, againſt which no Objection can be rais'd?</p>
                     <p>Even the Being of a <hi>God</hi> has been diſputed againſt by theſe ſort of Arguments; that is, by raiſing <hi>Objections,</hi> and ſtarting <hi>Difficulties,</hi> which may not eaſily be Anſwer'd: But while thoſe Demonſtrative Arguments, which <hi>Prove</hi> a <hi>God,</hi> remain unſhaken, a thouſand <hi>Difficulties</hi> are no <hi>Diſproof.</hi>

                     <p>But I lay down this, only as a general Rule; becauſe this Method is ſo much made uſe of by the <hi>Quakers</hi> (and others) who never think of Anſwering plain <hi>Proofs;</hi> but by raiſing a great <hi>Duſt</hi> of <hi>Objections,</hi> wou'd <hi>bury</hi> and <hi>hide</hi> what they cannot <hi>Diſprove.</hi>

                     <p>For there is no mention of <hi>Water</hi> in either of the <hi>Texts</hi> objected, only the ſingle word <hi>Baptize.</hi> And why then muſt they conſtrue

                     <p>They cannot refuſe it with any ſhew or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Reaſon.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may further obſerve, that in the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 8. <hi>Criſpus</hi> is only ſaid to have <hi>believed,</hi> which was thought ſufficient to infer, that he was <hi>baptized;</hi> which cou'd not be, unleſs all that <hi>believed,</hi> were <hi>baptized:</hi> Which, no doubt, was the Caſe, as it is written, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to Eternal Life, believed,</hi> And (Ch. ii. 41.) <hi>They that received the Word, were baptized.</hi> And (V. 47.) <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this is the <hi>Climax</hi> or <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> As many as are ordained to Eternal Life do <hi>believe:</hi> And they that <hi>believe,</hi> are <hi>baptized:</hi> And they that are <hi>baptized,</hi> are added to the <hi>Church.</hi>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here then this <hi>Objection</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> has turn'd into an invincible <hi>Argument</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                     <p>They have, by this, yielded the whole Cauſe: For if the <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 14. be <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> then that <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> Acts xviii. 8. muſt be the ſame: And conſequently all the other <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Acts,</hi> are, as theſe, <hi>Water-baptiſms</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides the <hi>Quakers</hi> Confeſſion (for they are unconſtant and may change their Minds) the thing ſhews it ſelf, that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14. was <hi>Water-baptiſm;</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> there <hi>thanks God that he baptized none of them but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius. Wou'd the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> thank God that he had baptized ſo <hi>few,</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Or wou'd he repent of baptizing with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Therefore it muſt be the <hi>Water-baptiſm</hi> which was here ſpoke of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But now, what is the Reaſon, that he was glad he had <hi>baptized</hi> ſo <hi>few</hi> with <hi>Water-baptiſm?</hi> And he gives the Reaſon, in the very next words. (V. 15.) <hi>Leſt any ſhou'd ſay, that I had baptized in mine own Name.</hi> What was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59246:29"/>the occaſion of this Fear? It is told from <hi>V.</hi> 10. That there were great <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi> among theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that theſe were grounded upon the AEmulations that aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in behalf of their ſeveral <hi>Teachers.</hi> One was for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> others for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and others for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This wou'd ſeem, as if the Chriſtian Religion had been contradictory to it ſelf:</p>
                     <p>As if <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> had ſet up againſt one another:</p>
                     <p>As if they had not all taught the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</p>
                     <p>As if each had preach'd up <hi>himſelf,</hi> and not <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And had <hi>baptized</hi> Diſciples, each in <hi>his own Name,</hi> and not in <hi>Chriſt's;</hi> and had begot Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and not to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To remove this ſo horrible a Scandal, St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues with great zeal, (V. 13.) <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Was</hi> Paul <hi>Crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the Name of</hi> Paul? <hi>I thank God, that I baptized none of you but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius; <hi>leſt any ſhould ſay, That I had baptiz'd in mine own Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There needs no Application of this, the Words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> are themſelves ſo plain.</p>
                     <p>He did not thank God, that they had not been <hi>baptized;</hi> but that <hi>He</hi> had not done it.</p>
                     <p>And this, not for any ſlight to <hi>Water-baptiſm;</hi> but to obviate the Objection of his <hi>baptizing</hi> in <hi>his own Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By the way, this is a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Inward
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59246:30"/>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> cometh not with <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Shew,</hi> but is <hi>within</hi> us, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 20, 21. Nor is it done in any Body's <hi>Name,</hi> it is an <hi>inward</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration upon the <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> is always done in ſome <hi>Name</hi> or other; in his <hi>Name</hi> whoſe <hi>Diſciple</hi> you are <hi>thereby</hi> made and <hi>Admitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore it muſt, of neceſſity, be the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm,</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks; becauſe it was <hi>outwardly</hi> Adminiſtred, in ſuch an <hi>outward Name.</hi> And he makes this an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had not made <hi>Diſciples</hi> to <hi>himſelf,</hi> but to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> becauſe he did not <hi>baptize</hi> them in <hi>his own Name,</hi> but in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>Now this had been no <hi>Argument,</hi> but perfect <hi>Banter,</hi> if there had been no <hi>outward Baptiſm,</hi> that the People cou'd have both <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard.</hi> How otherwiſe cou'd they tell in what <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>no Name</hi> they were <hi>baptized,</hi> if all was <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Inviſible?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I need not prove what the <hi>Quakers</hi> grant and contend for, that all this was meant of <hi>Water-baptiſm;</hi> becauſe otherwiſe their whole Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from this place, does fall.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. But they wou'd infer as if no great ſtreſs were laid upon it; becauſe that <hi>few</hi> were ſo <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That there is nothing in the <hi>Text</hi> which does infer, that <hi>few</hi> of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were <hi>baptized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> only thanks God, that he <hi>himſelf</hi> had not done it, except to a <hi>few,</hi> for the Reaſons before given: But <hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 8. it is ſaid, That
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59246:30"/>beſides <hi>Chriſpus,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf <hi>baptized,</hi> MANY <hi>of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>wer baptized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, they were all <hi>baptized,</hi> as many as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> as before is prov'd. And, in this very place, St. <hi>Paul</hi> taking it for granted, that all who <hi>believed,</hi> were <hi>baptized,</hi> which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerv'd from his Queſtion to <hi>certain Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> Acts xix. 3. not whether they were <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> but <hi>unto what,</hi> i. e. <hi>In what Name,</hi> they had been <hi>baptized?</hi> So here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 13. He does not make the Queſtion, whether they had been <hi>baptized?</hi> That he takes for granted. But <hi>in what Name, were ye baptized?</hi> Which ſuppoſes, not only that <hi>all</hi> were <hi>baptized,</hi> but likewiſe that all who were <hi>baptized,</hi> were baptized in ſome <hi>outward Name;</hi> and therefore that it was the <hi>Outward,</hi> i. e. <hi>Water-baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">VII. But the ſecond Text objected, <hi>V.</hi> 17. is yet to be accounted for; where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel.</hi> This he ſaid in juſtification of himſelf for having <hi>baptiz'd</hi> ſo <hi>few</hi> in that place; for which he bleſſes God, becauſe, as it happened, it prov'd a great juſtification of his not baptizing in <hi>his own Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then, on the other hand, here wou'd ſeem to be a Neglect in him of his Duty: For if it was his Duty to have baptized them <hi>all,</hi> and he baptized but a <hi>few,</hi> here was a great Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to this, we find, that there was no Neglect in not <hi>baptizing</hi> them, for that, not a <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were <hi>baptized,</hi> Acts xviii. 8. that is, as many as <hi>believed,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſhewn.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59246:31"/>
                     <p>But then who was it that <hi>baptized</hi> thoſe <hi>many?</hi> For St. <hi>Paul baptized</hi> but a <hi>few.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> employ'd others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, to <hi>Baptize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he vindicates this, by ſaying, That he was <hi>not ſent to Baptize,</hi> i. e. <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>chiefly;</hi> that was not the <hi>chief</hi> part of his Commiſſion: But the <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>difficult</hi> part was that of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to <hi>Diſpute</hi> with, <hi>Perſwade</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> World. To this, <hi>great Parts,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Miraculous Gifts</hi> were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But to Adminiſter the <hi>outward Form</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm</hi> to thoſe who were <hi>Converted,</hi> had no Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it; requir'd no great <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> only a <hi>lawful Commiſſion</hi> to Execute it.</p>
                     <p>And it wou'd have taken up too much of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, it was impoſſible for them to have <hi>baptized,</hi> with their own Hands, thoſe vaſt Multitudes whom they Converted. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had reach'd to all Quarters of the then known World, as far almoſt, as at this Day, before the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left the World. And cou'd Twelve Men <hi>Baptize</hi> the <hi>whole World?</hi> Their <hi>Progreſs</hi> was not the leaſt of their <hi>Miracles:</hi> The <hi>Bread of Life</hi> multiply'd faſter, in their <hi>Diſtribution</hi> of it, than the <hi>Loaves</hi> by our <hi>SAVIOUR</hi>'s <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them. St. <hi>Peter</hi> Converted about <hi>Three Thouſand</hi> at one Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. And at another time about <hi>Five Thouſand,</hi> Ch. iv. 4. <hi>Multitudes both of Men and Women,</hi> Ch. v. 14. Many more than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cou'd have <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> much more than they cou'd have <hi>baptized;</hi> for which if they had ſtay'd, they had made ſlender Progreſs. No. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ſent, as <hi>loud Heraulds,</hi> to <hi>Proclaim</hi> to all the Earth,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59246:31"/>to run ſwiftly, and gather much People; and not to ſtay (they cou'd not ſtay) for the <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> with their own Hands, all that they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: They left that to others, whom they had ordain'd to Adminiſter it. Yet not ſo, as to exclude themſelves; but they themſelves did <hi>Baptize,</hi> where they ſaw occaſion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here did BAPTIZE <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> ſome of the Principal of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Not that he was oblig'd to have done it himſelf, having others to whom he might have left it: For he was not <hi>ſent,</hi> that is, put under the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> with his own Hands, but to <hi>Preach,</hi> to Convert others, that was his <hi>principal</hi> Province, and which he was not to neglect, upon the account of <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> which others could do as well as he.</p>
                     <p>But if you will ſo underſtand the Words of his not being <hi>ſent,</hi> i. e. that it was not within his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> that he was not <hi>Impower'd</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> then it wou'd have been a <hi>Sin,</hi> and great <hi>Preſumption</hi> in him, to have <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> any body.</p>
                     <p>Nay more. This Text, thus underſtood, is flatly contradictory to <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. which ſays, <hi>Go, Baptize:</hi> And this ſays, <hi>I am not ſent to Baptize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are contradictory, if by, <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> be underſtood, I have not <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to <hi>Baptize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But by, <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> no more is meant in this <hi>Text,</hi> than that <hi>baptizing</hi> is not the <hi>chief</hi> or <hi>principal</hi> part of my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> As if a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> were accuſed for <hi>Muſtering</hi> and <hi>Liſting</hi> Men <hi>in his own Name,</hi> and not in the <hi>King</hi>'s, and

                     <p>Or if (to come nearer) a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſhou'd ſay, That he was not <hi>ſent</hi> to <hi>Teach School;</hi> this wou'd not imply that he might not <hi>Keep School;</hi> nay, he ought, if there were no others to do it: So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was not <hi>ſent</hi> to ſpend his Time in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing, Viſiting the Sick,</hi> or other Parts of his Duty (which others might perform) ſo as to hinder his great Work in Converting of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> All of whom he cou'd not <hi>Baptize,</hi> nor <hi>Viſit</hi> all their <hi>Sick:</hi> Yet both theſe were within his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and he <hi>might</hi> and <hi>did</hi> Execute them where he ſaw occaſion. As if all the <hi>Sick</hi> in <hi>London</hi> ſhou'd expect to be <hi>Viſited</hi> by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London;</hi> and all the <hi>Children</hi> ſhou'd be brought to be <hi>baptized</hi> by him; he might well ſay, That he was not <hi>ſent</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> or to <hi>Viſit</hi> their <hi>Sick,</hi> but to look after his <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And ſend them for theſe <hi>Offices,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, under him: and yet this wou'd no ways imply, that theſe Offices were not within the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59246:32"/>
                        <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Commiſſion; or that he was not <hi>ſent</hi> both to <hi>Baptize,</hi> and to <hi>Viſit the Sick:</hi> But only that he was not ſent <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize,</hi> or to <hi>Viſit the Sick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as to that Phraſe of being <hi>ſent;</hi> we find it us'd in this ſame ſenſe, to mean only being <hi>chiefly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> ſent. Thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlv. 8. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren. <hi>It was not you that ſent me hither, but God.</hi> It was certainly his <hi>Brethren</hi> who <hi>ſent</hi> him, for they <hi>ſold</hi> him into <hi>Egypt:</hi> But it was not They, <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>chiefly,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> who had other and extraordinary Ends in it.</p>
                     <p>Adam <hi>was not deceived</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 14.) <hi>but the Woman being deccived, was in the Tranſgreſſion.

                     <p>Again. As for you who ſtick ſo cloſe to the <hi>Letter</hi> (when it ſeemeth to ſerve your turn) <hi>Go ye and learn what that meaneth,</hi> I WILL HAVE MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE, <hi>Math.</hi> ix. 13.</p>
                     <p>By which it cannot be underſtood, that God did not require <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> for he <hi>commanded</hi> it upon Pain of <hi>Death.</hi> Yet he ſays, (<hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 22.) <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor commanded them — concerning Burnt-Offerings, or Sacrifices: But this thing Commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my Voice,</hi> &amp;c. according as it is written (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 22.) <hi>To obey is better than Sacrifice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all which cannot be meant, that God did not Command the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning <hi>Burnt-Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> (for we know how particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they were commanded) but that the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59246:33"/>Sacrifice</hi> was not the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> part of the Command; which reſpected <hi>chiefly</hi> the <hi>inward</hi> Sacrifice and Circumciſion of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which when they neglected, and lean'd whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Outward,</hi> then God deteſts their <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Iſa. i. 14. <hi>Your new Moons, and your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Feaſts my Soul hateth, I am weary to bear them.</hi> And he ſays, V. 12. <hi>Who hath required this at your Hand?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was certainly <hi>God</hi> who had <hi>requir'd</hi> all theſe things at their hands; but theſe <hi>outward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances</hi> (tho' the <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Abuſe</hi> of them was puniſhed with <hi>Death</hi>) yet they were not the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> part of the Command, being intended <hi>chiefly</hi> for the ſake of the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Part: From which when they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, they were (like the <hi>Body,</hi> when the <hi>Soul</hi> is gone) a <hi>dead</hi> and a <hi>loathſome</hi> CARCASS of <hi>Religion:</hi> And which <hi>God</hi> is therefore ſaid, not to have commanded, becauſe he did not Command them without the other: As he made not the <hi>Body</hi> without the <hi>Soul;</hi> yet he made the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Soul.</hi>

We are commanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. to <hi>Preſent our</hi> Bodies <hi>a living Sacrifice,</hi> and this is call'd our <hi>Reaſonable Service.</hi> For, is it not Reaſonable, that, ſince our <hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>God</hi>'s Creatures, as well as our <hi>Souls,</hi> He ſhould have the <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> as well as of our <hi>Souls?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no <hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Publick</hi> WORSHIP but by our <hi>Bodies;</hi> we cannot <hi>otherwiſe</hi> expreſs the INWARD <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of our <hi>Minds.</hi>

                     <p>And whoever deny the <hi>Outward Worſhip</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or perform it <hi>ſlovenly,</hi> and <hi>careleſly,</hi> it is a full Demonſtration that they have no <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Real Devotion,</hi> or <hi>Juſt Apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>Outward</hi> Part of <hi>Religion</hi> muſt, by no means, be let go, becauſe the <hi>Inward</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dies, when the <hi>Outward</hi> is gone.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Outward</hi> and the <hi>Inward</hi> WORSHIP of <hi>God</hi> are not <hi>Two</hi> Worſhips, but only Two <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Worſhip. As <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59246:38"/>are not <hi>Two Men,</hi> but <hi>Two Parts</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Man; ſo the Adoration of this <hi>One</hi> Man, <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> in his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Inwardly</hi> in his <hi>Soul,</hi> is not Two <hi>Worſhips,</hi> but Two <hi>Parts</hi> of the SAME <hi>Worſhip.</hi>

                     <p>The Ingenious <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> writing againſt ſome <hi>Diſſenters</hi> amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> aſſerts the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> very high, and <hi>the Power of the Elders in the Church,</hi> p. 13. and preſſes that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 17. <hi>Tell it unto the Church,</hi> to extend to Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as well as to Private <hi>Injuries</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59246:42"/>or <hi>Offences</hi> amongſt <hi>Chriſtians. That Chriſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as well gave His Church Power to Reject as to Try Spirits, is not hard to prove. That notable Paſſage,</hi> Go, tell the Church, <hi>does it to our hand: For if in caſe of private Offences betwixt Brethren, the Church is made Abſolute Judge, from whom there is no Appeal in this World; how much more in any the leaſt caſe that concerns the</hi> NATURE, BEING, FAITH, <hi>and</hi> WORSHIP <hi>of the Church her ſelf?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Caſe was quite alter'd when he came to Anſwer that ſame <hi>Text,</hi> as urged againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> by the <hi>Church;</hi> which he does in his <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants,</hi> p. 152, 153, &amp; 154. of the <hi>Second Edition</hi> in <hi>Octavo,</hi> printed 1692. And then that Text does not relate at all to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but only to <hi>private Injuries.</hi> For having deny'd the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> he puts the Objection thus againſt himſelf: <hi>But what then can be the meaning of Chriſt's Words,</hi> Go, tell the Church? <hi>Very well. I Anſwer</hi> (ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 153.) <hi>'Tis not about</hi> Faith, <hi>but</hi> Injury, <hi>that Chriſt ſpeaks; and the place explains it ſelf, which is this;</hi> Moreover, if thy Brother ſhall TRESPASS againſt THEE, go and tell him his FAULT, between thee and him alone. <hi>Here is</hi> Wrong, <hi>not</hi> Religion; Injuſtice, <hi>not</hi> Faith <hi>or</hi> Conſcience <hi>concern'd; as ſome would have it, to maintain their Church-Power. — The words</hi> TRESPASS <hi>and</hi> FAULT <hi>prove abundantly, that He only meant</hi> Private <hi>and</hi> Perſonal Injuries; <hi>and that not only from the common and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſignification and uſe of the words</hi> TRESPASS <hi>and</hi> FAULT, <hi>but from the way Chriſt directs and commands for Accommodation,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59246:42"/>wronged ſpeak to him that commits the Injury, alone; if that will not do, that he take one or two with him: But no Man can think, that if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to</hi> FAITH <hi>or</hi> WORSHIP, <hi>I ought to Receive the Judgment of one, or two, or three, for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule. — Therefore it cannot relate to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> FAITH, <hi>and Scruples of</hi> CONSCIENCE, <hi>but</hi> PERSONAL <hi>and</hi> PRIVATE INJURIES.</p>
                     <p>Thus he. But tho' the Judgment of <hi>one, two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> is not of it ſelf a <hi>ſufficient Rule,</hi> (none ever ſaid it was) yet may not <hi>one, two,</hi> or <hi>three</hi> ADMONISH one another, even in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as well as of <hi>Private Injuries,</hi> and, in caſe of <hi>Refractorineſs</hi> and <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> bring the Cauſe before the <hi>Church?</hi>

                        <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe Rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi> Yet was not the <hi>Judgment</hi> of every Man a <hi>ſufficient Rule</hi> to his Neighbour.

                     <p n="4">IV. But I wou'd beſeech them to conſider how much more highly God does value it; and how Material a part of his Religion he does make it: For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was taught the Faith immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Heaven, and not from thoſe who were <hi>Apoſtles</hi> before him (as he tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 16, 17.) <hi>Chriſt</hi> took care to inſtruct him as to this of <hi>the Lord's Supper</hi> particularly. And he preſſes it upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as having receiv'd it from God. <hi>For I have received of the Lord</hi> (ſays he, 1 Cor. xi. 23.) <hi>that which alſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame Night in which he was Betrayed, took Break,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo goes on to relate the whole <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and the mighty Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, the Benefits and Advantages of it; the <hi>Examination</hi> preparatory to it; and the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> which was due to the <hi>Contempt</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>This ſhews, that <hi>Christ</hi> did not Inſtitute this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> by Chance. It was the laſt Act of his Life; and his <hi>Dying Bequeſt</hi> to his <hi>Church;</hi> fill'd with all his <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> and carrying with it, to the <hi>Worthy Receivers,</hi> the whole <hi>Merits,</hi> and <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and full Title to <hi>Heaven!

                        <hi>tho' it be but a Man's Teſtament, yet, if it be confirmed, no Man

                     <p>This was the Reaſon that it was not only ſo particularly Recorded by the ſeveral <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> in the <hi>Goſpels;</hi> but when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was taught immediately from <hi>Heaven,</hi> this moſt Material <hi>Inſtitution</hi> was not forgot, but <hi>Christ</hi> Himſelf inſtructed him in it; to ſhew the great Streſs and Value which he laid upon it.</p>
                     <p>And let this ſuffice, to have ſaid in this place, concerning this other Sacrament of <hi>the Lord's Supper.</hi> Its <hi>Inſtitution</hi> is as Plain and Expreſs as that of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of it, in the Days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and all Ages ſince has been as <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. And here let me obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That theſe <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> make Incompatable to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> State, ought only to be underſtood of the <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> which were ordain'd as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59246:48"/>
                        <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And of theſe it is truly argu'd, That when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> is come, they muſt ceaſe of courſe; which Argument the <hi>Quakers</hi> bring againſt the <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Inſtitute under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> But how foreign this is from their purpoſe, let any one judge. For thoſe <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> which were appointed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cou'd not be <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> becauſe a <hi>Type</hi> is what goes <hi>before</hi> a Thing, and ſhews it to <hi>come.</hi> And therefore, when that which it <hi>foreſhews</hi> is come, it ceaſes. But, as there were <hi>Types</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>foreſhew</hi> Chriſt's coming in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> which therefore are ceaſed; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> has appointed other <hi>Types</hi> to foreſhew his <hi>ſecond Coming</hi> to Judge the World; and which therefore muſt laſt till he ſhall ſo come, as the <hi>Types</hi> of his <hi>firſt coming</hi> did laſt, till he did ſo come. The <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> did <hi>praefigure</hi> the <hi>Death of Chriſt;</hi> but the <hi>Sacraments</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of it; as well as for <hi>Types</hi> of our future <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with <hi>him</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Therefore the ſame Reaſon which makes the <hi>Legal Types</hi> to <hi>ceaſe,</hi> does infer, That the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Types</hi> muſt <hi>not ceaſe,</hi> till they likewiſe ſhall be <hi>fulfilled;</hi> which will not be till we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at <hi>Heaven.</hi> Thus, as they are <hi>Types.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As they are <hi>Remembrances</hi> of what is paſt, they are to laſt as long as the <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of that which they <hi>Repreſent</hi> ought to laſt with us. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not Inſtitute <hi>his Supper,</hi> that we ſhou'd thereby <hi>Remember</hi> his <hi>Death,</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> or a <hi>Year,</hi> but till his <hi>Coming again.</hi> His <hi>Death</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59246:48"/>took his <hi>Perſonal</hi> Preſence from us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till that Return, we muſt continue the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> that is, of his <hi>Abſence,</hi> till the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Return of his <hi>Viſible Body,</hi> which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from us by his <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus no advantage can be brought to the <hi>Quaker</hi> Pretences againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Sacraments,</hi> from the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and other <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. We come now to Examine, what they ſet up againſt any <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> from another Topick; and that is, That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is all <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and therefore that there muſt be no <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> at all in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>Subſtance</hi> here they mean that which is <hi>Inward,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> that every thing in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>Spiritual.</hi>

                     <p>But this will overthrow all <hi>Outward,</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi> Worſhip. For that is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Inward</hi> Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>And, in one ſenſe, all <hi>Bodily</hi> Worſhip is a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Inward,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual;</hi> which is the <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Worſhip. Thus <hi>Bowing</hi> the <hi>Knee,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovering</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> at <hi>Prayer,</hi> are <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>Inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this the <hi>Quakers</hi> practiſe; therefore, by their own Argument, they have <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> as well as others; only they throw off thoſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, and make new ones of their own.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to be without <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</hi> For this whole World is a <hi>Figure</hi> of that which is to come. We our ſelves are <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>

And we now have the Knowledge of God <hi>in the Face of Jeſus Christ.

                     <p>Now, though ſeveral Significations of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> are already paſt, as the Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the Entrance into <hi>Canaan;</hi> and

                     <p>But there is another Reaſon for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and that is, That it was not only ordained as a <hi>Type</hi> of Things to come; but as a Commemoration of what was paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Rest</hi> from his Works of <hi>Creation.</hi> And, by the Alteration of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> it ſerves likewiſe to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as a Commemoration of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Conqueſt over the Powers of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> It was the <hi>first Day</hi> in which <hi>Light</hi> was created; and <hi>Christ</hi> (who is our <hi>True Light,</hi> of which the <hi>Viſible Light</hi> is but a <hi>Shadow,</hi> and was ordain'd as a <hi>Type</hi>) <hi>Aroſe</hi> from the <hi>Dead,</hi> the <hi>ſame Day;</hi> and gave <hi>Light</hi> to thoſe who ſat in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Shadow</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> by the Joyful Tidings of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> from <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Bliſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now ſo long as the Works of our <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> are to be kept in Memory, ſo long is the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to continue, as a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe Ineſtimable Benefits.</p>

How much rather then when He ſaith to thee, Waſh and be Clean?</hi> And as <hi>neceſſary</hi> as the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Jordan</hi> were to the <hi>Cleanſing</hi> of <hi>Naaman,</hi> ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> are the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to the <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of our <hi>Souls.</hi> None dare ſay, That GOD cou'd not have Cleanſed <hi>Naaman</hi> otherwiſe: But GOD having, by his <hi>Prophet,</hi> appointed that Means, if <hi>Naaman</hi> had neglected it, he had not otherwiſe been Cured.
